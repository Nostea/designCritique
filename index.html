          We will review your designs (website or mobile/web app) and explore
          where the design works well and where it can be improved. We focus our
          process around one central question: “What can we do to make this
          design more efficient?”

          <h2>Deliverables</h2>
          <h3>A picture is worth a thousand words</h3>
          <p>
            Unlike any other design review or audit, we will not only tell you
            what can be improved but also make revamps to the most critical
            parts of the design.
          </p>
          <h3>Design Report</h3>
          <p>
            We will evaluate your design based on a variety of parameters and
            provide a detailed visual report with useful tips and design hacks.
            This would be the starting point for further work on the design.
          </p>
          <h3>Ways to Redesign</h3>
          <p>
            We provide several strategies for further redesign by various
            contractors, from freelancers to high-end agencies. We provide you
            with an assessment of the timing and cost for both a full redesign
            and quick but effective improvements.
